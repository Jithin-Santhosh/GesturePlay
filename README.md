GesturePlay 🎮🖐️
Wave hello to hands-free gaming! GesturePlay unlocks a new level of fun: control browser games with your webcam and the magic of computer vision. Built in Python and powered by some AI tricks, GesturePlay will make you rethink how you play.

🚀 What is GesturePlay?
GesturePlay is not your regular game controller.
It’s a tool that watches your hand, reads your moves, and instantly translates them into keyboard controls for your favourite browser games.
No gamepad? No problem. No keyboard? Who needs it?
Just raise your hand and play like a wizard.

✨ Features
Real-time gesture detection (move left, right, up, down—no delay, no wires)

Universal game compatibility: If your browser game uses WASD or arrow keys, GesturePlay speaks its language

Easy setup: Just install, run, and wave your way to victory

Python-powered: OpenCV + MediaPipe + pynput for magic under the hood

🏁 Demo
Raced the tracks in TOP SPEED 3D using nothing but my palm—check out the demo GIF/video in this repo!
