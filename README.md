## 🚀 What is GesturePlay?

GesturePlay is not your regular game controller.
It’s a tool that watches your hand, reads your moves, and instantly translates them into **keyboard controls** for your favourite browser games.
No gamepad? No problem. No keyboard? Who needs it?
Just raise your hand and play like a wizard.

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time gesture detection** (move left, right, up, down—no delay, no wires)
- **Universal game compatibility:** If your browser game uses WASD or arrow keys, GesturePlay speaks its language
- **Easy setup:** Just install, run, and wave your way to victory
- **Python-powered:** OpenCV + MediaPipe + pynput for magic under the hood
